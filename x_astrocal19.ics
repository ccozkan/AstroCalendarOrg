 age\nshower\, with up to 40 meteors per hour at its peak. It is thought to
 \nbe produced by dust grains left behind by an extinct comet known as\n200
 3 EH1\, which was discovered in 2003. The shower runs annually from\nJanua
 ry 1-5. It peaks this year on the night of the 3rd and morning of\nthe 4th
