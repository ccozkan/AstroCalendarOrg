 by early Native American tribes as the Sturgeon Moon because the\nlarge st
 urgeon fish of the Great Lakes and other major lakes were more\neasily cau
 ght at this time of year. This moon has also been known as\nthe Green Corn
  Moon and the Grain Moon. Since this is the third of\nfour full moons in t
 his season\, it is known as a blue moon. This rare\ncalendar event only ha
 ppens once every few years\, giving rise to the\nterm\, “once in a blue mo
 on.” There are normally only three full moons\nin each season of the year.
  But since full moons occur every\n29.53 days\, occasionally a season will
  contain 4 full moons. The extra\nfull moon of the season is known as a bl
 ue moon. Blue moons occur on\naverage once every 2.7 years. (copyright: se
